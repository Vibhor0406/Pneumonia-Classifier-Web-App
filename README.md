### Project Description

**Pneumonia Classifier Web App**

This project is a web-based application designed to classify chest X-ray images as either pneumonia-positive or negative using deep learning models. Leveraging the Flask framework for the web interface, the app integrates TensorFlow and Keras for model training and prediction. OpenCV and NumPy handle image preprocessing, while Matplotlib visualizes the results.

**Real-World Applications:**

- **Early Detection**: Assists medical professionals in the early detection of pneumonia, potentially improving patient outcomes through timely intervention.
- **Accessibility**: Provides a tool that can be used in resource-limited settings where access to radiologists may be scarce.
- **Efficiency**: Enhances diagnostic efficiency by quickly processing and analyzing large volumes of X-ray images.

By automating pneumonia detection, this app supports healthcare providers in making quicker and more accurate diagnoses.
